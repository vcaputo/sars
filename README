Building from source:

You've probably already done this, but first clone the repo:
`git clone --recursive https://git.pengaru.com/git/sars`

Now it's fairly run of the mill autotools:

```
$ mkdir build
$ ./bootstrap
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
$ ./src/sars
```

The program assumes there will be assets found under the assets/
folder relative to the sars executable's parent directory.

These are some .ogg files and .wav files, and they're not checked
into the git repo to keep development low-bw friendly.

You may find the assets in a build available at:

https://dl.pengaru.com/hungrycat/sars/

The latest build should reflect the current state of the master git
branch:

There's also a Pouet entry for sars with youtube and other links:
