Building from source:

You've probably already done this, but first clone the repo:
`git clone git://git.pengaru.com/sars`

There are a few submodules which must be initialized recursively
before sars will be able to compile, this does the trick:

`git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`

*** New enough git versions support recursive clone too:
` git clone --recursive git://git.pengaru.com/sars`

Now it's fairly run of the mill autotools:

```
$ mkdir build
$ ./bootstrap
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make
$ ./src/sars
```

The program assumes there will be assets found under the assets/
folder relative to the current working directory.

These are some .ogg files and .wav files, and they're not checked
into the git repo.

This README will be updated in the future with links to where the
production .zip has been uploaded on the wider internet, from those
archies you can grab the sound assets if desired.
